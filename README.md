# 👁️ EchoEyes

**EchoEyes** is an intelligent face recognition and analysis application powered by computer vision.  
It uses **OpenCV** and machine learning techniques to detect and interpret human faces in real-time, providing insights or actions based on recognition results.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 👤 **Face Detection:** Detects human faces in images or video streams using Haar Cascade classifiers.  
- 🧠 **Core Recognition Logic:** Modular core (`echoeye_core.py`) designed for easy extension and integration with other systems.  
- ⚙️ **Custom Role Handling:** Role management and access configuration stored in `roles.json`.  
- 💡 **Plug-and-Play Design:** Simple `app.py` entry point makes it easy to deploy or expand.  
- 🧩 **Extensible Architecture:** Well-structured Python code allows developers to add new models, APIs, or UI layers.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, JSON, and other standard Python libraries  
- **Tools:** Haar Cascade model for facial recognition

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EchoEyes.git
   cd EchoEyes
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install `opencv-python` manually:)*

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the main application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Depending on how you’ve implemented the logic, the app may:

* Open a webcam and detect faces in real-time, or
* Process input images for recognition tasks.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Detection:**
   The system uses the `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml` model to locate faces within an image or video frame.

2. **Recognition Core:**
   The `echoeye_core.py` file contains the face recognition and analysis logic — this can be customized for emotion detection, user identification, etc.

3. **Application Layer:**
   The `app.py` file manages input/output operations, UI, or server endpoints depending on deployment type.

Would you like me to include a **`requirements.txt`** file (based on the Python code in your project) so it’s ready to upload together?
